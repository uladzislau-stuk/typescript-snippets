// Tuples

/*
* Tuple types allow you to express an array
* with a fixed number of elements whose types
* are known, but need not be the same.
* For example, you may want to represent a value
* as a pair of a string and a number:
* */

// Declare a tuple type
let x: [string, number];
// Initialize it
x = ["hello", 10]; // OK
// Initialize it incorrectly
x = [10, "hello"]; // Error
